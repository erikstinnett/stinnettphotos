                        My name is Erik Stinnett and I am a Computer Science student at the 
                        University of Central Arkansas with a love for the night sky! <br>
                        I've been into astronomy for as long as I remember: I remember getting 
                        a book about the Hubble Space Telescope as a kid and being absolutely
                        in awe of the beautiful photos that the Hubble took. <br><br><br><br>
                        My first dip into astrophotography was on a chilly October night in 2019 
                        when I took out my Meade LX200 and attempted to take photos of the moon 
                        by pressing my phone against the eyepiece.<br> 
                        The results, as one could expect, were blurry and out of focus. <br>
                        This night, however, triggered an interest in
                        photographing the night sky. I've spent much of my time since investing 
                        in astrophotography, learning, practicing, and, of course, learning some more!

                        <i>The Dark Side of Lighting</i> is the culmination of two years of work. As a student
                        of the University of Central Arkansas' Schedler Honors College, I get to complete
                        a Capstone project that I have spent multiple days (and nights) working on. <br><br>
                        As an astrophotographer, the issue of light pollution strikes close to what I love doing
                        on a nightly basis. I felt that light pollution and its effects on our planet is not widely
                        known nor talked about and I wanted to make a change. <i>The Dark Side of Lighting</i> is meant to
                        do just that: spread awareness of the issue of light pollution and the brightening of our nights.
                        <br><br>This Capstone project combines two disciplines, astrophotography and web development, in order
                        to spread the message. By utilizing 360-degree panoramas I aim to visualize the impact that artificial
                        light has on our skies in the best way that I know how. I've taken two panoramas at Steel Creek, on the 
                        Buffalo National River, a dark-sky site, and am juxtaposing them with two panoramas taken at Harris
                        Brake Lake, a light-polluted region. These panoramas will be displayed at the Griffin Planetarium 
                        on UCA campus during my Capstone presentation on April 27th. <br><br>
                        As a Computer Science student, I wanted my Capstone to represent something that I could see myself
                        doing as a career. I wrote this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning so much on the way.
                        I wanted to use this website to be not only my personal photography portfolio but also as a means to 
                        host the 360-degree panoramas along with information about light pollution on an online platform.

                        Between 2021 and 2022 we built a roll-off roof observatory in our backyard.
                        This set-up allows me to leave my gear up permanently instead of dragging it
                        in and out of the garage every day. The observatory also allows me to not have to
                        keep an eye on it every night, as it is behind a locked door and four walls. <br><br>
                        Thanks to the ASIAIR and remote desktop, I am able to control my telescope from anywhere 
                        I want, meaning I've been able to do astrophotography while I've been away for college.
